# My recipes webapge

A recipes webpage created with React and using Typescript. Also used Contentful as CMS and getting all recipes through an API call.

This was our individual project that we made so everything is designed and coded my me alone. This is a work in progress and right now its MVP :)

You can have a look at my Design that I did in Figma here:
